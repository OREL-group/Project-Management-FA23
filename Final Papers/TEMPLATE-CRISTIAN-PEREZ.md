# Abstract

This paper is a proposal for an open-source project based on the open-source principles taught in IS 340: Project Management taught by Dr. Bradley Alicea. The project is Open GPT an open-source collaborative AI capable of chatbots, content generation, and sentiment analysis. The goal is to create an AI model open to the public made by open-source participants, the model is designed to be on the same scale as current private solutions (Chat GPT, Google Bard, etc). We hope to inspire upcoming generations to become involved in the AI revolution not just as users or consumers but also as developers.

# Project Background

Artificial intelligence has recently come to the forefront of the tech world, with the release of Chat GPT the AI revolution began. However, the development of AI has primarily taken place within the confines of massive tech companies that keep their algorithms hidden and inaccessible to the wider research community and the general public.<br />
It has become extremely obvious that AI is an extremely powerful technology that will be gatekept from the general public, thus it is imperative an open-source initiative is undertaken to demystify AI and allow the average consumer to participate in the AI revolution. Enter Open GPT. Its mission revolves around a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model â€“ a remarkable linguistic entity capable of comprehending and generating human language a model like Chat GPT which many may already be familiar with. Unlike closed-source counterparts, Open GPT is not a solitary entity. Instead, we envision a GPT model that is created through the collective efforts of diverse expertise, knowledge, and computational resources. <br />
This project is not dictated from above; rather, it is a collaborative endeavor built from the ground up by a vibrant community of developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts, each contributing their unique skills to the overall design. Open GPT stands as a testament to the transformative power of collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity, with the aim of democratizing the field of AI and empowering individuals to shape the future. Democratization lies at the very heart of our vision. <br />
Open GPT aims to break down the barriers built by private companies who are leading the development of AI. We embrace transparency by providing open access to our code, data, and research. We firmly believe that true progress is not achieved by hoarding secrets, but by sharing them and opening the doors of innovation to all.
