# Abstract

This paper is a proposal for an open-source project based on the open-source principles taught in IS 340: Project Management taught by Dr. Bradley Alicea. The project is Open GPT an open-source collaborative AI capable of chatbots, content generation, and sentiment analysis. The goal is to create an AI model open to the public made by open-source participants, the model is designed to be on the same scale as current private solutions (Chat GPT, Google Bard, etc). We hope to inspire upcoming generations to become involved in the AI revolution not just as users or consumers but also as developers.
