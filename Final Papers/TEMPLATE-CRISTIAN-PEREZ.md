# Abstract

This paper is a proposal for an open-source project based on the open-source principles taught in IS 340: Project Management taught by Dr. Bradley Alicea. The project is Open GPT an open-source collaborative AI capable of chatbots, content generation, and sentiment analysis. The goal is to create an AI model open to the public made by open-source participants, the model is designed to be on the same scale as current private solutions (Chat GPT, Google Bard, etc). We hope to inspire upcoming generations to become involved in the AI revolution not just as users or consumers but also as developers.

# Project Background

Artificial intelligence has recently come to the forefront of the tech world, with the release of Chat GPT the AI revolution began. However, the development of AI has primarily taken place within the confines of massive tech companies that keep their algorithms hidden and inaccessible to the wider research community and the general public.<br />
It has become extremely obvious that AI is an extremely powerful technology that will be gatekept from the general public, thus it is imperative an open-source initiative is undertaken to demystify AI and allow the average consumer to participate in the AI revolution. Enter Open GPT. Its mission revolves around a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model – a remarkable linguistic entity capable of comprehending and generating human language a model like Chat GPT which many may already be familiar with. Unlike closed-source counterparts, Open GPT is not a solitary entity. Instead, we envision a GPT model that is created through the collective efforts of diverse expertise, knowledge, and computational resources. <br />
