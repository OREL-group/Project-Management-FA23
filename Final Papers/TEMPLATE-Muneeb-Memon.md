### Abstract   
MyLeague is a project that aims to create a platform that allows people to manage and organize sporting leagues for a variety of sports. This paper outlines the goals of MyLeague while emphasizing its impact on the sports leagues in different communities through the use of open-source principles and effective project management strategies. MyLeague is set to simplify the process of creating and overseeing a sports league by providing a platform that can help with league creation, game/match/event scheduling, and player performance tracking within local leagues and across regional areas. MyLeague harbors features such as league configurations, tools for managing teams, automated match scheduling, a certified venue database, and a comprehensive player statistics system. The platform’s goal is to actively encourage community members to engage by communicating through discussion forums and integration with social media platforms to post updates and highlights. It aims to create an environment where league participants can interact with each other, share updates, and foster a sense of community for amateur/semi-pro level sports. Additionally, it includes tools for assigning referees and officials to ensure fair games/matches without any implication of bias. Transparency and accessibility are crucial components of the project given its open-source structure. All the information and documents related to the project are openly shared publicly through platforms such as GitHub. Contributors can actively participate in discussions through forums, coding platforms, and video conferencing tools to allow an open space to work on improvements for MyLeague. The project aims to foster inclusivity and recognize the contributions that are made by each community member by allowing a space where the league is truly customizable and buildable for each community. MyLeague, with improvements for the community around it, can become the first sports league run by players who can participate within the leagues created. Similar to fantasy football, but with an actual league for sports that are played throughout the year. At its core, this community-based initiative has guidelines that promote a respectful environment for everyone involved in the activities throughout the leagues. The guidelines also aim to encourage collaboration and communication amongst those involved to help come up with improvements for everybody's experiences. Regular online meetings provide an opportunity to share updates and address any concerns while giving time to strategize ways to enhance the leagues.

### Introduction
Throughout history, people always looked to sports as an outlet and competition that provided health benefits as well as an enjoyable activity. The love for playing sports is an addictive thrill that many crave even after earlier days of organized sports. From beginner leagues for kids up until high school, there are avenues of participation for individuals to be involved. In college, people can either play for school teams, club teams, or Intramural leagues. There seems to be no stabilized avenue for competition for people who do not attend college or have graduated beyond their collegiate days. This is where MyLeague steps in as a platform that can allow any individual in any community to create a league of their own. Similar to the structure of fantasy football, there are one or more commissioners who develop a league for any of the sports selected. Participants then sign on and create teams to play within the league and if they choose to do so, compete outside the league with other league champions. The system is created to allow people who want to play sports in their free time to determine the difficulty, structure, and style they want to play. The league is built through open-source principles that apply to the UI and functionality of the platform, but also to the stylistic sense of play when it comes to physical participation within leagues.

### Purpose

The purpose of MyLeague is meant to address the void in organized sports for individuals who are not full-time athletes or in any sort of professional league. As people either grow up playing in a structured environment or want to start playing a new sport, MyLeague provides them an opportunity to do so. MyLeague not only steps in to help existing leagues manage their system, but also acts as a versatile and customizable opportunity for individuals to step into the realm of organized sports once again. The vision for community-driven sports will have an opportunity to provide sporting experiences for a variety of individuals, whilst having the infrastructure to organize and manage those sporting experiences. MyLeague can help fill the post-collegiate void that leaves sports enthusiasts without an avenue to impact in coaching or participatory recreation of sports whilst also helping youth and high school sports manage their leagues. MyLeague draws inspiration from Fantasy Football infrastructures that help create a vision for participant-backed commissioning for leagues to develop their own smaller ecosystems. Ranging from one individual to a board of commissioners can be established to manage a league's structure, therefore giving management experience to sports fans who enjoy front-office ordeals more than physical playtime. MyLeague also serves to its commitment to the customization of leagues. Often times in professional and organized sports, rules and regulations are debated in terms of applicability and fairness. With MyLeague, each league sets its own parameters to have a localized competition or season in order to be flexible for players. The styles of play ranging across sports can also be selected to give everyone an inclusive approach to playing sports that they are accustomed to. With open and closed league settings, individuals can create a private organization for their league, or create a public league where people across the region can join or apply to compete depending on the sport. MyLeague provides a unique yet customizable sporting experience for any and all individuals. The competitive scale can also be adjusted to help address the concerns of sports fans who prefer an easy-paced enjoyable league versus a competitive high-level league. MyLeague's purpose transcends conventional sports league management; it envisions a transformative shift in how communities engage with sports. By embracing open-source principles, customization, and community-driven development, MyLeague seeks to empower individuals to actively shape their sporting destinies. In essence, the purpose of MyLeague is to democratize sports engagement and provide a platform that not only manages a league but also nurtures a community where participants are active architects of their sporting experience. This vision goes beyond the creation of leagues; it strives to create a thriving sporting ecosystem where every participant is a contributor, collaborator, and co-creator.

### Target Audience
The target audience for the app is structured to 3 personas. Firstly, the platform can be used for structuring and scheduling youth sports organizations as official software to assist existing leagues. This for example could be leagues such as Pop Warner which have existing teams and leagues, but MyLeague can connect all players and teams to one central league platform that helps with stats tracking and game scheduling. This would be available for leagues that are rated K-12, which would include high school athletics. The second target audience would be individuals who are 18-25 and are either not in college or do not have adequate intramural structure and want to engage in sporting activities. This is also where the customization aspect for leagues takes into effect since there is a diverse set of sports and structures that can be set up based on communities and styles of play. Lastly, individuals who are past the age of 25 and no longer have collegiate sports to play, can use MyLeague to set up more competitive leagues to still play at higher levels, whilst also being able to structure the league in a way to fit their lifestyle not being professional athletes. The 3 personas are based on individuals rather than sports but the primary focuses for sports will be Football, Basketball, and E-Sports as they are the biggest “pick-up” sports that are played outside of league structure, but have a large amount of daily participants.

### Strategy
The strategy to develop this platform will be based on a few tools. Firstly, the development cycle will be produced through GitHub since it is an open platform that will allow for the project plans to be visible. Keeping the collaborative efforts through the forums and coding platforms that enable open access is essential to the principles of open-source and to ensure users can be a part of their own leagues as well as an overarching sports ecosystem being created with MyLeague. GitHub will allow for the community to have access and grow while they collaborate with each other. When it comes to the technology stacks, the front end would be React Native. React Native enables us to write code once and then apply it to both iOS and Android platforms, which ends up saving a lot of time and effort. In an effort to be as inclusive as possible for users, React Native ensures we can use cross-platform development and just focus on the code versus focusing on reformatting between iOS and Andriod. The backend would be run through Django with GraphQL. Django is known to scale efficiently and handle increasing traffic and data as the application grows. Being such a large application that is customizable for its users, MyLeague needs to stay up to date as it grows larger with the more amount of users and leagues that are created. In terms of data itself, GraphQL allows for an efficient way to query and mend data which allows us to request and swiftly through data we need to make improvements versus an overload that needs more data cleaning. Django also comes with ORM, admin panels, and authentication systems that allow us to reduce external dependencies like software libraries, packages, or modules that are not part of the core functionality of the programming language. The database to store and manage data will be MySQL because of the reliability that it has and the simplicity of usage. It also has very secure database transactions based on ACID compliance. For the security of the platform, OAuth will be used because it is a widely accepted authentication protocol that enhances the security for users' data. It also has third-party integration that will work to simplify user authentication with social media sites that MyLeague will sync to for users to seamlessly use both platforms to post about events. The hosting capabilities will be through AWS given its scalability and reliability. It is not only a massive global network, but also one of the most reliable hosting services on the market. In essence, the technology stack is a combination of popular and well-supported tools to ensure a scalable, secure, efficient, and maintainable solution for MyLeague to be a cross-platform app that ensures user satisfaction and developer convenience.

### Community
At the heart of MyLeague’s purpose is to foster a new sporting ecosystem that helps create leagues around the world. The platform encourages active engagement through participation in leagues or with the assistance of developing and customizing leagues. That platform allows for discussion forums to be used to converse on structural components of making the platform better and creating new features for the community that go beyond the offerings that are preset in MyLeague. The platform is also seamlessly intertwined with social media where each league and player can be linked with an account to post highlights, updates, stories, and accolades. This creates a sense of virtual community that correlates to the in-person events for competitive or charitable games/matches. Regular online meetings and admin channels can be used to send updates, resolve concerns, and collaborate on work to enhance the league experiences and rules.

### Conclusion

In retrospect, MyLeague is a game-changer in the world of community-based sports involvement. It offers a personalized platform that goes beyond sports league management. What sets MyLeague apart is its open-source approach allowing individuals not to participate in sports leagues but to actively contribute to shaping and improving the platform itself. The inclusivity of MyLeague is evident from its target audience, which includes youth sports organizations as well as individuals of all ages making it accessible and versatile for sports enthusiasts of any generation. However, MyLeague's purpose goes beyond filling the gap in organized sports after college. It envisions a future where communities have a role in shaping their sporting experiences by fostering collaboration, customization, and inclusivity. By offering league settings and a wide range of sporting options every participant can enjoy a unique experience with MyLeague. The strategic development approach employed by MyLeague showcases its commitment to scalability, security, user-friendliness, and overall success. By utilizing platforms like GitHub for collaboration React Native for cross-platform functionality, Django with GraphQL for scalability purposes, and AWS for reliable hosting services. MyLeague places an emphasis, on fostering a sense of community. It goes beyond facilitating the creation and management of sports leagues. The platform actively encourages engagement through discussion forums, integration with media, and regular online meetings. By providing a space for participants to connect, share updates, and collaborate on improvements MyLeague aims to cultivate a sporting ecosystem that extends beyond the boundaries of the digital platform. In essence, MyLeague is more than a platform for organizing sports leagues; it serves as a catalyst for transforming how communities engage with and shape their sporting experiences. MyLeague can allow people to be Adam Silver off the court and Lebron James on the court by giving them opportunities to create their own sporting world. By empowering participants to take charge and contribute to their sporting journeys MyLeague envisions a future where every sports enthusiast becomes a contributor, collaborator, and co-creator, in the thrilling realm of community-driven sports.
