## FreeFinder
Liz Tran, Fall 2023


### Abstract

In this paper, I will be introducing and proposing an open-source project called FreeFinder, a community-based platform that allows for easy access and searching of local information, such as free events, public Wi-Fi and restrooms, and free necessities nearby. This project will employ various open-source ideas and principles through its stages of development, such as community-building, documentation, and principles of working open. 

### Introduction

#### The Issue 

With applications like Google Maps, people can navigate and check different places to see what they offer, like restrooms or Wi-Fi. But at the same time, there is not really a central hub, platform, or application that allows for users to easily find information about free events, food, necessities nearby. To find this information, people would need to go looking through various applications and platforms depending on what they’re searching for. This is especially inconvenient, especially if someone does not know much about the area around them. To combat this issue, I’ve looked to develop a platform meant to work as a central place for users to understand the area around them, such as free events, Wi-Fi, parking, food, or other services and necessities nearby.  

#### Platform Overview 

This platform, called FreeFinder, informs users of local information, and they can easily access this in one area, rather than a variety of applications and websites. FreeFinder was inspired by Japan Official Travel App, which I used while traveling throughout Japan. This application was designed to help tourists navigate and find help, if need be, through a map-based feature that tells them about help centers, free Wi-Fi, public restrooms, and other necessities nearby. Similarly, FreeFinder provides similar information on its platform and other features. 

<br>

The target audience for this platform is meant to be more universal, serving users who need information about their surroundings, but the original target users are college students or college campuses. On a college campus, there are plenty of services and events nearby that many college students are unaware of. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a prime spot as currently, many events, food pantries, restaurant deals, and more are obscured behind a myriad of media sources. With FreeFinder, there will be a main source for information that communities, like students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, can use to enter and get information. This community-based platform will work off user input, so the community will be the main mode of information with potentially a system that can detect nearby deals from stores and restaurants. 

<br>

Thus, the potential features behind FreeFinder are a map-based feature that works off GPS as the main hub for local information, an event center that works as a community space for event advertisement, and a community forum for contributors and those who want to get involved. These features are set to change through various stages of development, testing, and revisions. 

### Project Overview 

#### The Principles

My overall goal of the project is to design a platform optimized for community interaction and simplified locating of local information. FreeFinder will be an open-source project, created and developed through an open community. The main project deliverable is to create a live website for desktops and a fully developed application for mobile devices. To do this, there needs to be a well-defined structure, which will be presented through the management plan and other documents, such as a budgeting document, roadmap, and more. The structure will be run through GitHub and other documentation tools. Since the project is open-source, there must be clear guidelines for the community, users, and stakeholders. These include full transparency about project information, such as data, milestones, and statuses, and strong consistent communication through tools to keep everyone informed and on track. 	

#### Working Open

Throughout the development of FreeFinder, principles of working open will be implemented. This means that there will be a community of volunteers, formed through community-building, to develop the platform, which will be primarily based on GitHub. For this community, principles of social capital must be enacted, which are trust, positive social attention, innovation, reciprocity, and altruism. Contributors will abide by the social contract, visible through the README.md file. Furthermore, the knowledge and information created by the project will be accessible widely and freely, so everyone can access and build on it through forks, and shares. FreeFinder’s community will be run through a system of mutual support, where members can cooperate through platforms like Discord and friendly competition through events like hackathons. There will be various open practices and tools to plan, manage, start and grow a community, and run events as need be (Mozilla, 2016). 

### Stages of Development 

For this project, there are 4 main stages of development, which are initiating, planning, executing, and closing (Coursera Staff, 2023). The closing stage is the only stage not thoroughly discussed because of the current state of progress for FreeFinder. 
<br>

___Initiating Stage___
<br>
The initiating stage begins with research to fully understand what the platform is for and about, such as potential competitors and target audience or community. In this stage, there was a Project of Interest (POP) chart employed to understand the purpose, outcome, and process of FreeFinder. Through this, the vision statement was created, which is “to develop a central hub for communities to gather, find, and share local information.” An open canvas, presented in Figure 1, was also used to fully understand the project goals, strategies for building the project and community, and resource requirements (AloisReitbauer, 2022). Within this stage, an early management plan is also formed to generate goals FreeFinder is attempting to achieve, which includes user research, platform design and development, and further analysis.

<br>

After the initial steps, FreeFinder will start as a GitHub repository with an MIT license because of its flexibility and simplicity. There aren’t many restrictions within the MIT license, so users who choose to modify versions of FreeFinder’s code only need to have the original license’s text and copyright statement (Codeacademy Team). The license will be visible in the README file. This file is a form of documentation, which will be consistent throughout all stages of development. Documentation in the initiating stage will create the framework for community-building. As mentioned previously, the project will be introduced through the README.md file, which will define its goals, licensing information, contribution questions and concerns, and purpose. In order to build a community, there will also be other basic documentation, such as CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files to provide guidelines for those who want to get involved. The CONTRIBUTING file will guide contributors on how to report issues, bugs, or technical requirements for different areas of their interest in contributing to. 

<br>

After these basic documents, the focus will shift to the community-building portion of the initial stages. Potential contributors and a community will be gathered through an engagement plan of advertisement via Internet and social media platforms, like Twitter and Discord. A potential community for FreeFinder would be an academic one, like university students or organizations, that may be interested in the project’s purpose. The open-source project will allow for contributors of different levels, from those with no-coding experience to those with coding experience. This means that the community is open to a wider audience of participants. To ensure community engagement, there will be rewards enabled through Discord and potentially GitHub, such as badges and experience points or level ups for participation. These are meant to be incentives, and with increasing points or rewards, contributors can reach a higher status within the community for their activity and work. 

<br>

For interested parties, there will be an onboarding guide as well as necessary files to help them understand the project and how to get involved, which include the files mentioned above. Since the project starts on a smaller scale, it can begin with a smaller community with its limited resources and expand as it grows. Discord and Slack will be used interchangeably for discussion among contributors and team members, while GitHub operates as the center for the project’s work.   
<br>

___Planning Stage___
<br>
After a community has been built, the planning stage begins with coordinating smaller meetings to discuss project milestones, tasks, and roadmap discussion and creation. Budget planning and management documents will also be created during this time, so FreeFinder’s development can run smoothly and sustainably. This will also let us know the current restraints for the project, so the scope and deliverables can be attained. In both planning and executing stages, collaboration among members will be distributed to accommodate time zone differences and availabilities. Video conference platforms, like Jitsi and Zoom, will allow for thematic meetings to be recorded and stored on a YouTube playlist that can be accessed and viewed through Discord and Slack. Notes pertaining to these meetings will be taken through Google Docs and shared for easy access. Discussion threads and chats will also be utilized for organization through Discord and Slack. The GitHub repository will continuously update to match the current state of planning. These forms of technologies stay consistent throughout the planning and executing stages. 

<br>

Sections of the project will be sorted and decided amongst community members according to their interests and expertise, with tasks being delegated and created through workflow maps. These sections include UI/UX design research, user interface design and prototyping, and software development for desktop and mobile platforms. Throughout this process, communication between different sections of the project will remain consistent through Discord, while Slack will be utilized for work within a specific section. The planning stage ends with a kick-off meeting about FreeFinder, where members will discuss the documentation about current plans, tasks, milestones, and other necessary information to start the executing stage. 
<br>

___Executing Stage___
<br>
Following the kick-off meeting, the project will continue the communicative technologies mentioned above, like Slack and Zoom, in the executing stage. For different areas, there will be workflow maps to follow for asynchronous coordination within different teams. Bots will be implemented within Slack and Discord to moderate, automate meeting coordination and tasks, and control discussion as necessary. GitHub issue board will provide an area to identify and sort tasks and issues for FreeFinder, such as user testing for the application’s prototype and bug fixes once released. Throughout this stage, there will be consistent documentation of the progress and statuses of current tasks, milestones, and deliverables. For new contributors, the community will follow an Alt-Ac organization that is interdisciplinary to allow a variety of disciplinary traditions, as well as offer a multitude of sources to keep them up to date.

<br>

There will also be sprints hosted throughout this stage, like Docathons to provide an entry point and guide to the project as it works on improving and filling in documentation that exists or may be missing. Furthermore, the phases of development for FreeFinder will follow an Agile Methodology, which follows a cycle of plan and design, develop, test and evaluate, and deploy and review.  This cycle is especially pertinent in FreeFinder’s user interface and software development, as it allows for continuous improvement based off user testing and feedback. It will follow the Release Early, Release Often (RERO) Development Methodology, so participants can find issues, debug, and release smaller changes or new ideas in small amounts (The Linux Foundation). This methodology will be enacted throughout FreeFinder’s soft launch, where the platform will be accessible to a smaller audience, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s campus for continuous testing. Throughout these phases, FreeFinder remains open and transparent about its data, code, and plans.   

<br>

Once thoroughly tested, FreeFinder will be open to a hard launch for a wider audience but will stay consistent with updates and changes according to feedback given by users. Throughout these launches, the project will maintain version control to track and manage changes made during the code’s developmental lifecycle. Documentation will also stay consistent through files on GitHub to inform users and involved parties of the different versions and what they include. The project will continue to employ the Agile Methodology throughout its launch to stay on track with updates according to user needs and issues. As FreeFinder furthers in its fully-developed state, the updates may slow in pace and become more seasonal, to maintain project sustainability.  	


### Conclusion      

In conclusion, FreeFinder proposes a central platform for simplified navigating and discovery of local information, such as events, Wi-Fi, services, and food through community input. As an open-source project, it highlights community-building as an essential in development, while utilizing principles of working open. FreeFinder’s emphasis on community allows it to be open to a variety of contributors, regardless of expertise or location. Various measures are employed to ensure full understanding of the project’s purpose and goals, and plans, like budget and resource management, are set in place to ensure feasibility. Throughout its developmental stages, documentation is consistent to maintain organization and transparency about the project for all. And as a platform, FreeFinder presents a solution to the myriad of websites and platforms of information, allowing for the user a simple solution with a single space. Thus, FreeFinder stays consistent in its vision statement of being a hub for community participation as it involves them in both its development and usage. It succeeds in creating a collaborative space built for and by communities.
