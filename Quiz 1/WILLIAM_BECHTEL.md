# Welcome To Quiz #1

My name is ***William Bechtel***, and as you can tell, I'm **very important**

## Chapter One

This is just a short one chapter story about myself. This is my 5th year here at U of I, as I didn't get into the iSchool until Spring of 2023.
I plan on graduating just before my 23rd birthday next May. I just have *two* semesters, with ***18 credit hours*** each, remaining.

Here's a handy table made with HTML explaining my major each semester I took classes
